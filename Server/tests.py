The Ministry was not capable of managing efficiently the vast number of requests from their over 3 million citizens. The Ministry did not have the technology infrastructure required to do so and this led to deficiencies in the maintenance task planning, overlapping and duplication of work, inefficiencies in the monitoring and control functions, and long times of response.SolutionThe City has just gone live with a Deloitte-led CRM solution implementation that enhances their existing SAP platform (also a Deloitte project), enabling them to better manage the volumes of data and projects to keep this cosmopolitan city beautiful. For 10 months, beginning in December 2013, the Deloitte team worked through the complete project lifecycle, from preparation and blueprint, to realization, final preparation, the live and a support engagement. BenefitJust two months after the September 2014 go-live and already the 100 employees of the environment and Public Spaces Ministry are reaping the rewards of the new system. The Environment and Public Spaces Ministry is now running a new IT completely integrated platform (SAP) for managing the citizens' claims, which will not only provide information in real time, but also will ensure the integrity of the data contained. It will also allow its users to introduce, administrate and share information in a standardized way and to eliminate the back office tasks.Real Time City GovernmentDeloitte, along with Siemens, implemented a Smart City Cockpit which enables better decision making by consolidating information from a wide range of administrative systemsSmart City CockpitChallengeThe information that is required to run the city effectively is dispersed in a number of administrative systems, with no integrated view. This resulted in decision making in silos, without considering the overall picture and all the processes that drive the city.SolutionDeloitte supported the implementation of a Smart City Cockpit, working with Siemens. The Smart City Cockpit provides the central platform for the diverse demands of citizens and local authorities. Data from municipality and country are published together with publically available data, and provided on one integrated platform. Predictive Analytics are developed and controlled in a central platform. BenefitThe Cockpit provides the city administration with a single integrated tool that supports better and faster decision making by consolidating information from a wide range of administrative systems. The Mayor will now be able to keep track of multiple processes that drive the city in real time. Citizens can also use the centrally provided information for their own applications and share these with other citizens via the Cockpit platform.Deloitte Contacts: Olaf Peter Schleichert (Berlin), Carsten Dolch (Dusseldorf)Real time traffic managementUsing real time information and predictive analytics to better manage traffic. Transport for LondonChallengeOver 26 million journeys begin on London's roads each day. The challenge of keeping the traffic moving on London's roads require real time actionable information available to traffic managers, enabling them to make timely interventions. SolutionDeloitte worked with Transport for London to build a real-time traffic management service. The tool monitors traffic flows as vehicles enter central London. Data from sensors is fed into an analytics engine which processes over 10 million vehicle captures per day. Deloitte designed and built the visual user interface and created a tool that gives traffic managers the information to make timely interventions to improve journey time reliability and alleviate congestion.BenefitThe real time traffic management service now enables the city and the traffic managers to take more informed decisions on interventions required for ensuring smooth traffic movement.Deloitte Contacts: Warwick Goodall (UK - London) Still Waiting for Partner permission for external use24x7 app for citizen engagementDeloitte designed and implemented an iPhone app to help Victoria Election Commission engage better with citizens, thereby ensuring a better voting process.Vote VicChallengeVoting in the state of Victoria can be a challenge as the public need information on hand to find the closest places to vote both before, and on election day.Would it be possible to create an iPhone app that would help Victorians, both in Victoria and abroad, to find the closest places to vote, both before, and on election day?SolutionDeloitte worked closely with key members from Information Victoria and the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) to come up with an elegant and usable iPhone application to display VEC information about voting centres and election results.BenefitThe application was download by 2,700 people on election day, 5,000 people in total, and featured in the top 50 most download apps for the week.This enabled a smoother voting process for the Victorians on a key political day and engaged the public on a personal level using a digital platform.Emergency Department Wait Times - Mobile WebsiteProviding timely access to quality care and giving the public honest and accurate data.NSW GovernmentChallengeGiven that emergencies don't always happen within easy access of a computer, mobile access real-time emergency information is critical.Would it be possible to create an iPhone app that would help Victorians, both in Victoria and abroad, to find the closest places to vote, both before, and on election day?SolutionThe Department of Health had already created a series of web services that collected information from emergency department management systems. Deloitte used this information to create a mobile site accessible by iPhone, Android and Blackberry devices.The mobile site provides details such as the closest hospital location, a map overlaying the suggested route and estimated driving time, number of people waiting to be treated, how many beds are in each emergency department and an estimate of waiting times.BenefitWith the mobile website, patients and carers can now make informed decisions about which hospital to go to, how to get there and what the likely waiting times will be.It also provides the opportunity to spread the load across NSW emergency departments.New mobile solution ensures health on the goOne of Australia's leading health, medical and lifestyle websites, the Victorian Government's the Better Health Channel (BHC), reaches over 1 million unique visits per month.Better Health ChannelChallengeWith Australians now regularly using smartphones for content browsing and applications, the Victorian Government's Department of Health wanted to broaden the delivery of the BHC message and service with a mobile application. SolutionDesigned to be intuitive for users, the app provides extensive BHC health and medical information, including health conditions, treatments, medical procedures and first aid. A location-based search helps find health providers, and urgent medical contacts and advice are offered. BenefitThe BHC mobile platform and content enables anywhere, anytime access to reliable health information and services for all Victorians. The app supports health consumers to establish and maintain positive health behaviours, make informed decisions, and manage their own and their family's health. Mobile solution makes parking downtown easierProviding commuters with an easy option for finding parking within the cityCity of San MateoChallengeThe busy downtown of San Mateo presented a challenge for commuters when finding parking. This resulted in increased congestion and inefficient use of space within the city. The city of San Mateo pursued an innovative solution to the increasing traffic problem. SolutionDesigned to be accessible for users, Streetline's Parker implementation provides real-time parking availability information, hands-free voice navigation and easy access to rates, hours and time limits. Parker also enables users to keep a track of where they parked their car and store pictures of their car location to help them remember where their car is parked.BenefitSan Mateo now has reduced traffic, emissions and driver frustration in the downtown area. The parking solution helps attract more people to enjoy the downtown San Mateo experience. Livestreaming council meetingsProviding county residents and businesses a way to engage in the democratic processMonmouthshire CouncilChallengeThe closed room nature of council room meetings did not allow for the residents, organisations and businesses of the Monmouthshire council to have transparency in the decision making process.SolutionThe council uses YouTube to broadcast and livestream meetings live.
